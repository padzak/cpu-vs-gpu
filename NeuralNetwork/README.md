# Dataset multiplication

The script  duplicates the entire dataset into a new directory named like dataset_x2 or dataset_x3, based on the duplication factor. 
All duplications are performed inside this new directory, leaving the original dataset untouched.

`python duplicate_png_dataset.py path_to_dataset 3`
